# Machine Learning

This is a repository consisting of the code written while learning and implementing machine learning concepts and algorithms.
It consists of algorithms from supervised, unsupervised and deep learning. We use Sklearn, Keras and Tensorflow during this time.

The following algorithms are implemented and used in this repository:
```
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. KNN
4. SVM
5. Decision Trees
6. Random Forests
7. Neural Networks
8. CNN
```
